# Amadare's Tweaks

---

This mod contains collection of small tweaks and improvements that I wanted but any of them didn't deserve a separate mod.
Configurable from in-game options (powered by RiskOfOptions).

## Tweaks

### Prevent Artifact Key Command Replacement

When doing Artifact Reliquary for Command artifact, Artifact Key will not become Command Essence so you can just pick it up.

### Other players item count

When hovering onto item, notification will show how many instances of this item other players have (including yourself if configured).

### Priority Beads

When using Cleansing Pool, there is a configurable chance for each bead in inventory that it would be prioritized before any other lunar equipment.
